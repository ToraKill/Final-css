<div class = "text2">This is Weston Smith about page where we go in depth into Weston's life

In the last few years, Weston discovered their love for coding using languages like Python, CSS, and Java. These 
languages weren't just tools to them; they were keys to unlock their creativity and bring innovative ideas to life. 
With Python, they could solve complex problems with logical thinking. CSS let them design stunning digital visuals, 
and Java helped them connect abstract ideas to practical applications.

Weston also loves anime and will watch countless hours on his streaming service of choice.

But Weston's story doesn't stop in the digital world. He also embraced the world of martial arts, where he 
found strength and balance.

Weston also used to work out alot but stopped in the safty of a relationship but now that thats over he's back in the gym trying to hit
his old PR's

Beyond coding and martial arts, and working out Weston explored the world of music through the soothing sounds of a violin.
 The violin provided an emotional outlet and a connection to human expression, adding another layer to his
  creative journey.

And in the midst of all this, Weston found a loyal companion in Anna, an adorable dog. Anna's presence
 reminded them of the importance of real-world connections and provided constant support, showing that life
  is about more than just screens and keyboards.
